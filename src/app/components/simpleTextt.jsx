        Our Approach To Dry wall Estimating
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[22px] font-poppins font-normal w-[90%] mx-auto mt-3">
        When preparing the drywall estimate, complete knowledge of the drywall
        installation process is required. Our drywall estimators start with the
        review of drawing plans and systematic bid documents to identify the
        scope of the projects. Then, using the latest takeoff software like
        Planswift, we measure the walls, partitions, and ceilings by the point
        and click methods. The use of digital software mitigates the chances of
        errors and the exact square footage are measured.
